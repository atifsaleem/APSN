This is a simple and flexible plugin to handle signups with the form fields you define.

== Description ==

Designed to make it easier to serve signup form on sites for LARP activities, this plugin aims to be very flexible in the way it handles input form fields.

What makes this plugin awesome is:

*   the ability for you to define the form you need to get the data you want.
*   the fact that it has been designed with the less is more paradigm in mind.
